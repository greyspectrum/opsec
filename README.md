# OPSEC: A PREDICTIVE THREAT ANALYTICS PLATFORM FOR INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS

*As seen in "Wired"... definitely very serious software, for serious individuals, in exceptionally serious situations.*

Journalists worldwide face unprecedented cyber threats from advanced, persistent cyber state actors, who are turning to sophisticated intrusion techniques to suppress adversarial journalism. Increasingly, we see tools and techniques that were orginally developed for foreign intelligence gathering being turned against domestic dissidents and reporters.

Unfortunately, it has become equally clear that journalists are unprepared to meet these new digital threats or adopt the digital defenses they need to protect their sources and operate in hostile environments.

Enter OPSEC. 

OPSEC automatically gathers threat information from a secure vantage point, by suspending the user's state inside a hypervisor and then collecting situationally relavent information and parsing a database of human-meaningful threats with natural language processing. Then, OPSEC develops operational security "playbooks" that are customized to the user's threat environment. Amazing!
