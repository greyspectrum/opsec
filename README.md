# OPSEC: A THREAT ANALYTICS PLATFORM FOR INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS

*As seen in "Wired"... definitely very serious software, for serious individuals.*

Journalists worldwide face unprecedented threats from state actors using advanced intrusion techniques. Increasingly, we see that tools and techniquesthat were developed for international intelligence gathering are being turned against domestic dissidents and reporters.

Unfortunately, it's become increasingly clear that journalists are unprepared to meet these new digital threats or adopt the tools and techniques they need to protect their sources and operate in hostile environments.

Enter OPSEC. OPSEC automatically gathers threat information from a secure vantage point by suspending the user's state inside a hypervisor and collecting situationally relavent information. Then, OPSEC develops operational security "playbooks" that are customized to the user's threat environment. Amazing!
